This is more about describing my personal development and debugging experience, less of a step-by-step tutorial on the topic. Correction to any of the errors is welcome!

## Problem statement 🍀

I have a React application with NestJS as the backend. Google App Engine is my target deployment environment. In my [Google App Engine deployment article](/brainstorm-a-deployment-process-from-github-to-google-app-engine-and-cloud-sql-part-2), I successfully made a dummy NodeJS application deployed to App Engine, however, that did not include the front end. Now, how should I host my single-page app there?

My folder structure is as followed.

```
- root
  - .github/workflows
  - front-end
  - back-end
```

## What are the approaches? 🤔

There are 3 ways that I'm aware of.

- Using two App Engine services and `dispatch.yaml`.
- Using one App Engine service to host both React and NestJS apps.
- Using one App Engine service to host NestJS app and another server to host static React files.

## Using dispatch.yaml 🔑

This can work when the back end and front end are loose couplings, and I want to utilize Google Identity Aware Proxy.

### What is `dispatch.yaml`?

It is a configuration file for **an App Engine** service. The term **service** here resembles **a Compute Engine instance** (not a direct equivalent though). A `dispatch.yaml` file overrides routing rules at an App Engine service level. Meaning, it is before a request reaches my API.

### Usage

Assuming my front end is deployed to service react at `react.uc.r.appspot.com/`, while back end is deployed to service api at `api.uc.r.appspot.com/`.

```yaml showLineNumbers
# dispatch.yaml
# Put this one in my 'front-end' folder
# Assuming this is a configuration for service "react"
# All requests to 'react.uc.r.appspot.com/api/*' are routed to 'api.uc.r.appspot.com/'
dispatch:
  - url: "react.uc.r.appspot.com/api/*"
    service: api
```

### Advantages and disadvantages

**Advantages**

- No need to worry about same-origin issues (e.g., CORS), because the resources are served via the same domain.
- Can separate the deployment of front-end and back-end (e.g., Creating a workflow that runs when only when files at a path are updated). Inherently increase redundancy and resiliency.
- Reduce server load.
- Both can be protected by Google Identity Aware Proxy.

```
# Sample of CORS error
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at ...
```

**Disadvantages**

- Not applicable when a front end is heavily dependent on the back end, this will be further discussed in the next approach.
- Might increase the cost since there are 2 App Engine services online.

## A back end stores React assets and statically serves them 🔑

Unlike the first approach, this one helps when the front end requires a resource from the back end at the first load. For example, my React app needs a CSRF token to work with my API. The CSRF token must be available when a user first reaches my website. To do so, my React app has to be served as static files from the NodeJS back end.

### Usage

The instruction below applies to the NestJS framework. My application is deployed to only one domain `back-end.uc.r.appspot.com`.

In my GitHub workflow, I copied the static React files to the back-end folder after React build process is finished.

```yaml showLineNumbers
# CI/CD pipeline
steps:
  ...
  - name: Build front-end
      ...
  - name: Copy front-end built to back-end folder
    working-directory: front-end
    run: |
      mkdir -p ../back-end/assets
      cp -R build ../back-end/assets
```

In `nest-cli.json`, use `compilerOptions` to copy React asset to NestJS dist build. Then, deploy only back-end folder to App Engine. React files are included and can be statically served.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  ...
  "soruceRoot": "src",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "assets": ["../assets/"]
  }
}
```

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages**

- Reduce cost as there is only one App Engine service online.
- No need to worry about same-origin issues (e.g., CORS), because the resources are served via the same domain.
- Can be protected by Google Identity Aware Proxy.
- Work with a tight coupling web application.

**Disadvantages**

- Increase server load as the whole single-page application lives on the same App Engine service.
- Cannot separately deploy back end and front end. A change in one place requires a whole new deployment. Inherently decrease redundancy and resiliency.

## Statically serve, but React files are hosted on another server 🔑

A common strategy, using (e.g., Google Cloud Storage Buckets) which is optimized for hosting static files can greatly improve performance. You can further fine-tune the server to other aspects too.

### Usage

It's essentially the same as the second approach, but with different configurations depending on situations, so I don't dive into this. An example of serving static files from Google Cloud Storage Buckets using App Engine can be found at [official Google Cloud Documents](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/serving-static-files).

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages**

- Better redundancy and resiliency.
- Better performance and is easier to fine-tune.
- Can separate the deployment of front-end and back-end (e.g., Creating a workflow that runs when only when files at a path are updated). Inherently increase redundancy and resiliency.

**Disadvantages**

- Might face same-origin issues (e.g., CORS) because files are hosted on another domain.
- Might not be able to activate Google Identity Aware Proxy for the front end.
- Work with a tight coupling web application.
- You need to have experience in using another static file hosting service, and using a different platform can decentralize your control.

## Wrap Up 🍀

In summary, I can

- Using 2 App Engine services if my React app and back end are loose couplings.
- Using App Engine to host back end, while using another service to host static files when I want even better performance, redundancy, resiliency.
- Using 1 App Engine to host the whole single-page application if it is tightly coupled.
