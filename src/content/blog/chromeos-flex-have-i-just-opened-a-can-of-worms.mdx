I have never been a Linux guru, but as a casual user, I love playing around with the operating system from time to time. At one point, I decided that Pop!_OS (or PopOS) is a stopping point after a long distro-hopping journey. It's a great all-in-one package with several core features ready to go out of the box: Desktop customization, dedicated GPU supports, Bluetooth codec supports, and whatnot, you name it! I'm satisfied with PopOS, and I still do, but a question eventually arose.

When coming to laptop usage, 95% of my time is spent on the browser. I boot up the laptop, open Firefox, search the web, consume media, and write articles like what you are reading now. For other more intensive tasks like gaming, coding and so on, my PC is responsible for them. Do I need a full-fledged highly customizable operating system for the laptop? Probably not, so ChromeOS came to my mind. In July 2022, Google announced a general availability for ChromeOS Flex (formerly CloudReady), a version that can be installed on non-Chromebook devices (any computer, in other words). In a sense, ChromeOS Flex is bleeding edge so it is expected to be somewhat unstable at the beginning, and I decided to wait until early 2023 to try it out, and here I am.

## Why did ChromeOS come to my mind?

- **Minimalism**: ChromeOS sacrifices lots of customizability but provides a decent set of Google applications out of the box. Chrome is in the name of the OS itself, so that alone covers 95% of my usage. Considering I have been working with different IT systems daily, I suppose having to tweak some Linux configurations outside of work hours is not that desirable. Don't get me wrong, playing around with technology has always been my hobby, but there is a line for when I just need to get things done, and ChromeOS provides that simple and minimalistic experience. That said, Linux on ChromeOS (or Crostini) is there, so I can always fire up the Linux environment if needed.

- **Lightweight**: The minimalistic approach inherently means no bloatware comes with ChromeOS. It consumes about 20 GB of storage and 1.7 GB of RAM out-of-the-box. Nothing spectacular though, as PopOS is relatively the same. Both ChromeOS and Linux blow Windows 10/11 out of water because Microsoft somehow makes their OS consume more than 60 GB and storage and around 6 GB of RAM with a fresh installation. Technically, this resource consumption is negligible to my laptop specification (AMD Ryzen 7 5825U CPU, Solidigm P41 Plus 2TB SSD, and 64GB of RAM), but it is always better to remove those data-harvesting programs when possible.

- **Security**: When considering a fresh installation, ChromeOS is arguably more secure than PopOS or other Linux distros. Minimalism greatly reduces the attack surface and ChromeOS was designed with security in mind using sandboxing and limited user write access. I'm by no means an expert on cybersecurity matters, but there are lots of resources online regarding this topic, and [Security in Chrome OS](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/security/chromeos_security_whitepaper.md) is an example.

## And my first try? Well, it was worse than I expected

Living on the edge is nothing new to me, eventually, things will work out. That is, assuming the fundamentals are satisfied, at least to a certain degree. The stable, beta, and canary versions are 110, 111, and 112 respectively at the time of writing. In my case, I tried out ChromeOS Flex using all those versions on three different laptop models (from Dell, HP, and Asus), and all exhibited breaking bugs in one way or another. What were they then?

### Network chipset compatibility

At the moment, ChromeOS Flex does not support Intel AX210 and Mediatek MT7921 wireless modules. Unfortunately, two of my laptops have these so I could not even start the OS installation process because ChromeOS Flex requires Internet to set up. That said, these are documented in *ChromeOS Flex Help - Known Issues*, so it is acceptable to me. However, being a PC hobbyist, I have a plethora of computer components lying around, so I decided to try other modules which yielded the following results.

- Intel AC3168 (unknown revision): Recognized
- Intel AC7265 (unknown revision): Bluetooth was recognized, but no Wi-Fi
- Intel AX200 (unknown revision): Recognized
- Realtek - wireless module (missing label, unknown model): Unrecognized
- Realtek RTL8118 - USB to 1 Gbe ethernet: Rev 3000 was recognized, while rev3100 was a hit or miss (might be due to USB implementation)

These are widely used wireless chipsets and have long been supported in the Linux mainline kernel. Clearly, ChromeOS Flex needs to address these somehow.

### Other miscellaneous hardware compatibilities

Unlike network chipset which has only a few big players on the market such as Intel, Mediatek, Qualcomm, and Broadcom, other components of the laptops are from more obscure providers and have a lot of variations. Using the PopOS's latest version (kernel v6.1 at the moment), there are still certain compatibility issues, so I suppose it is understandable for ChromeOS Flex to stay behind in this aspect. For example.

- The touch function of a laptop screen did not work during an initial OS installation but is fine after getting to the desktop.
- The touchpad, meanwhile, worked in the OS installation phase but became unusable after getting to the desktop. There were also times the touchpad worked fine from start to finish, but got disabled in a lock screen. Generally said, it was a hit or miss.
- Speakers had the same issue as the touchpad.
- The fingerprint was completely not supported on the three laptops I tried.
- No tablet mode detection when the screen passes a 180-degree angle (e.g., no rotation, no auto on-screen keyboard).

### Somewhat lackluster in user experience

Although using a minimal OS is my goal, ChromeOS Flex is missing certain features that reduce my overall experience. They are not breaking deals though, but worth mentioning. For example.

- Chrome tabs do not close after the browser exits, and there is no option to decide whether to keep tabs between sessions. Apparently, ChromeOS Flex simply does not support this, and the user must right-click on a browser tab, and then choose to *close other tabs* before exiting the browser. It is an oversight in my opinion.
- Website scroll speed is very inconsistent, as in, the acceleration kept jumping around. It seems this was once reported in Chromium Issue 836258, but it is not viewable anymore.
- ChromeOS Flex has worse settings than PopOS, such as no main monitor resolution, no time to sleep, no sleep button, and no Bluetooth codec adjustment.
- No trivial way to enable the tablet mode, which is commonly used when a laptop is a 2-in-1 type. The workaround I found was to enable the ASH shortcut flag in Chrome then press CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+T to enter and exit the tablet mode.
- There is a disassociation between mouse action and touch gestures in tablet mode. For example, swiping right means return but it is only doable with a touch gesture, not with a mouse cursor.
- Even inside the tablet mode, the on-screen keyboard does not automatically open when typing and must be manually turned on (and off) in Settings. This creates a blockage when a user switches between desktop and tablet mode frequently.
- Non-standard way to enable an extra keyboard for special characters. Keyboards in other operating systems tend to reserve SHIFT for capitalization or expand options of one key, and an extra keyboard can be accessed using a special button at the corner. Meanwhile, SHIFT is used to switch keyboard types in ChromeOS Flex.

The list goes on, but again, not that big of a deal. Then, I found a serious issue with ChromeOS Flex which can potentially harm my laptops in the long run, and that was...

### Completely broken sleep system

Using a laptop, I rarely shut down the machine, rather, sleep is my usual choice. Why? It is simply about convenience, what is better than just opening the lid and all your applications is there in their previous state? And yet, Chrome OS completely broke my laptop's sleep functionality. There are three types of breaking bugs.

- **The laptop cannot wake up from sleep:** I'm away from the keyboard or close the lid, and the laptop goes to sleep (screen off, keyboard-led off, fan spin down, no battery drain). However, when trying to turn it on, the fan spins, and the keyboard LED lights up, but no screen. In this case, the screen is completely off (no backlight), and HDMI output does not provide a display signal. Only forcing the shutdown by pressing the power button can exit this state.
- **The laptop cannot go to the sleep state:** I'm closing the lid, and the laptop *does not* go to sleep (screen off, keyboard-led off, fan either spins down or keeps rotating, battery drains even faster than usual).
- **The laptop is unresponsive after waking up:** On one of my laptops that uses HDD, when the laptop goes to sleep (as expected) and wakes up. It is normal in the lock screen, but after singing, the user inputs (keystroke, mouse movement) are delayed for more than 1 minute, which effectively renders the laptop unusable. I have to force shutdown with the power button to exit this state. This persists through HDD replacement, but the problem disappears when using an SSD.

Here is the best part, these problems randomly happen but at a very high frequency, likely more than 80% of the time. I consider them harmful to my system because repetitive behaviors like force shutting down (unsafe shutdown) and battery drain can potentially corrupt the OS or even degrade the hardware over time.

Are these isolated issues that only happen to my laptops? Maybe, but I could not identify the root cause.

## Wrap up

ChromeOS Flex, in my opinion, is still very worth a try and I like what it offers at the very early phase like now. Lightweight, security, and minimalism, these aspects can bring your device a new life, be it a powerful machine or one that has been in storage for years. Feature-wise, it is expected to not be comparable to a full-fledged operating system such as PopOS, and that is completely fine to me. Without the very broken sleep functionality, I may have continued my journey with ChromeOS Flex and its ecosystem, but for now, I have to postpone the plan. I wonder, a year from now, what will Chrome OS Flex become?

**Bonus, here was what I found in the log for type one (wall of text, with my educated guess on their meaning). In this scenario, I opened the laptop and signed in, then let it stay there (not open any program or do anything) until the sleep kicks in.**
