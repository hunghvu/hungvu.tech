Why do I want to find a headless content management system (headless CMS) to build my website for portfolio and blogging purposes? The blogging platforms like Hashnode, Dev, Hackernoon are certainly great places to start. They helped me write and published articles in minutes. That said, I would like to own my data and further, customize the website completely. This is only achievable by creating everything from the ground up, and it would be a fun side project for me so why not!

I started blogging as a hobby, but over time, I realized owning a website is a great way to showcase my experience and opinions. This allows me to further my reach, establish a firm digital presence, and open a gateway to more opportunities. Depending on your niches, there are blogging platforms that help you bootstrap a blogging profile and bring you closers to the audience.

With that said, this article presents my research on headless CMSs and my assessment of available solutions on the market with a focus on support for a blog and portfolio website. Via this article, you can learn about the concept of headless CMS, aspects to consider when choosing a headless CMS, feature comparisons between available CMSs on the market, and what are suitable solutions. This overview includes 12 different headless CMSs, both open-source and proprietary: Strapi, Directus, Sanity, Hygraph (previously named GraphCMS), Prismic, Ghost, Storyblok, Webiny, Contember, Payload, KeystoneJS, and Contentful. I am, by no means an expert in the world of headless CMSs, but hopefully, this is a decent starting point for you.

Also, the follow-up article is available at [Strapi vs Directus vs Payload, Headless CMS Comparison](strapi-vs-directus-vs-payload-headless-cms-comparison).

## What is a CMS?

In software development, we can generally say there are three main components: a front end, a back end, and a database. The *front end* is a presentation layer so clients can interact with an application server, in other words, it is the user interface (e.g., static web page, mobile application interface). Meanwhile, business logic is processed on the back end (server), and the *database* is used to hold user data.

Traditional CMSs usually use a monolithic architecture, hence it contains all these three components, and the front end is considered the **head** of CMS. Instead of building your product, traditional CMSs take care of everything for you. They provide pre-defined templates, from the presentation layer to security, data storage, user transactions, and many more. From social media, employee management, and whatnot, there is a pre-built CMS that serves your use cases.

### What are the categories of CMSs?

Generally, there are four different categories of CMSs:

**Web-based CMSs (traditional CMSs)**

- They are domain-specific CMSs and serve as a low-to-no-code solution. Website builders are prime examples of this category.
- They are mostly closed-source and the least customizable in this list. That said, being almost no code required, web-based CMSs are the most user-friendly and can help non-technical users bootstrap their products in a relatively short amount of time.
- The solutions in this category are mostly for enterprise content management (ECM), or web content management (WCM).

**Web-based CMSs (but in a decoupled state)**

- Still web-based CMSs, but the front end is removed, and contents are now served via APIs. This is their approach to becoming "headless". However, they are considered decoupled systems, not pure headless CMSs.

**Pure headless CMSs**

- When talking about *headless*, this means there is no presentation layer in place (**no head**) and all of the content (e.g., blog article) is distributed via endpoints (APIs). By design, pure headless CMSs are front-end agnostic, so there is freedom in choosing a front-end technology stack of your own. If you are interested in front-end technologies, I had written an article about this topic before: [Which front-end frameworks and libraries should you learn in 2022?](https://hungvu.tech/front-end-tech-stack-components)
- From this category onward, more pre-built, open-source and developer-friendly CMSs appear. Inherently, flexibility in development is increased. These headless CMSs are generic by default, that said, some can specialize and optimize in certain verticals such as eCommerce, marketing, and so on.

**Customized MACH-based CMSs**

- MACH architecture stands for microservices, API first, cloud-native, and headless, and this category means you build up the whole CMS from the ground up.
- This is the most powerful type of CMS but came at the cost of heavy development resources. For example, the social media that you are using right now are humongous CMSs composed of several different technologies and require different teams of experts to develop, deploy, and maintain.

<BlogImage imageMetadata={image1} alt='Catergories of content management systems.' />

Each category offers self-host, managed-host, and software as a service (SaaS) approaches, but user-friendly solutions towards the right in the diagram are mainly SaaS and vice versa. However, the current trend of the market seems to move toward the middle (grey area), and hence a blurry line is there. The next-gen headless CMSs offer a better user experience and become more focused on a certain vertical, while still maintaining their scalability, open, and developer-friendly nature. On the other hand, traditional monolithic CMSs are trying to be more modular and decoupled as a way to mitigate their downsides and attract a new wave of customers.

As a web developer myself, a headless CMS would be a perfect choice for building a portfolio and blogging site. There is no need to create an extreme MACH-based CMS for such a small website. Besides, the further my website grows, the more advantages I can benefit from the headless CMS due to its customizability and developer-friendly nature.

## Headless CMSs and decoupled CMSs are not entirely the same

Headless may sound *decoupled* to you, and indeed it is, but a headless CMS is more of a subset of the decoupled system. Traditional CMSs can be used in a decoupled manner. For instance, WordPress can operate without the front end, or "headless", but there are two key distinctions:

- The decoupled CMS itself has a built-in presentation layer by design, so since its inception, WordPress has assumed principles for designing the front end and what it can work with.
- The decoupled CMS itself has pre-defined business logic, object definition, and architecture. They are not supposed to be changed or are relatively unintuitive to modify.

Because of these, a traditional-but-decoupled CMS does not work well when you want to expand the views of your product, or migration to a different technology stack (e.g., on different operating systems). The **headless CMSs** solve this by:

- Having no assumption of the front end.
- Allowing developers to model their data schemas from the ground up.

With the separation of concerns, the headless CMSs can be hosted in one place while the front end resides on another server, and changes on one do not affect the other. This freedom allows developers to use a headless CMS as a single source of truth for their multi-platform application, while still being able to optimize and deliver the data in a consistent and structured manner via APIs. Inherently, headless CMSs greatly improve other aspects such as modularity via microservices, scalability, performance, and security.

## What to consider when choosing a headless CMS for your portfolio and blog?

This is a contextual question as the answer varies depending on your requirements. Do you want the best performance? Do you want stricter user control? So on and so forth. From a non-expertise perspective, I would ignore most technical aspects for now. In reality, I doubt my website can push the CMS to its extreme anytime soon. Also, considering we have like millions of headless CMSs on the market, I only discuss some popular choices in the article. With that said, let's lay down some core questions to make the comparison:

- Does it have a free plan?
- Is it open-source?
- How can we host it?
- What types of content-query APIs does it support?
- What types of text editor does it provide by default?
- Does it have TypeScript support?
- Does it have a media library?
- Does it support plugins?
- Does it support single sign-on (SSO)?
- Does it support article scheduling?
- Does it support internationalization?
- Does it support any form of content backup or migration?

## Which headless CMS should you choose for your portfolio and blog?

In the pictures above, you can see the summary of the feature comparison between 12 CMSs based on my research using their documents and marketing materials. Now, let's try to determine suitable CMSs for the portfolio and blog then.

- I prefer the CMSs that are free and offer a self-host option. GraphCMS, Prismic, Storyblok, and Contentful are proprietary SaaS. Meanwhile, Sanity stores data on their server, so they are out. SaaS and managed hosting are certainly useful, but to me, it is even better to have freedom of choice.
- I only have experience with REST APIs at the moment, so its support is a must. Therefore, Webiny and Contember are out. That said, I might try out GraphQL in the future, so it is great if the CMSs support both options.
- Media library is a huge addition for maintenance and user experience in the long run. Ghost and KeystoneJS lack this feature, so they are out.

This leaves only **Strapi, Directus, and Payload** left. Out of the three, it seems like only Directus has all of the checkmarks, however:

- Directus admin UI is in Vue, while I am a React developer. This can potentially become an overhead to maintain.
- Strapi has a much larger community.
- Both Strapi and Payload CMS offer a React admin UI.
- These three CMSs are fairly feature-parity.

With that said, I cannot define the winners here. For the next steps, I will download and try out all these three headless CMSs, then write down deeper pros and cons comparisons between them. After all, my observation right now is only the tip of the iceberg, so there is not enough information for a satisfactory conclusion.

## Wrap up

This is my very first step in getting into the headless CMSs world. Via this article, we have discussed the role of CMSs in software development, the categories of CMSs, and what headless CMS is about. Besides, we have talked about the important features of CMSs, the comparison of available solutions on the market, and what are the suitable CMSs for your portfolio and blog. Writing everything down gives me a point of reference (like a specification document), and I wish this can give you a sense of starting point too.

Now, which CMS would be your choice for a portfolio and blog site? Please let me know in the comment section below!
