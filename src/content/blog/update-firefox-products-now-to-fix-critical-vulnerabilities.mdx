During the Pwn2Own Vancouver 2022 hacking event, Manfred Paul demonstrated an attack on the Firefox browser that involves two types of vulnerabilities: prototype pollution ([CVE-2022-1802](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2022-19/#CVE-2022-1802)), and improper input validation ([CVE-2022-1529](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2022-19/#CVE-2022-1529)). The attack took about _8 seconds_ to perform, resulting in a sandbox escape and eventually controlling the victim's operating system. In practice, users can be affected right after visiting a malicious website on a vulnerable system.

Two days after the demonstration, Mozilla released Firefox 100.0.2, Firefox for Android 100.3.0, Firefox ESR 91.9.1, and Thunderbird 91.9.1 to patch the vulnerabilities. Other Firefox-based browsers such as Tor are also affected by the vulnerabilities. Users and system administrators are recommended to upgrade the affected products to the latest version as soon as possible.
