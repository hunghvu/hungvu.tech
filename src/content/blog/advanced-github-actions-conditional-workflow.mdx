This is more about describing my personal development and debugging experience, less of a step-by-step tutorial on the topic. The article presents some key points and questions I faced when going through the project. Correction to any of the errors is welcome!

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Actions, I recommend you read my [introduction to GitHub Actions components article](/what-is-github-actions-a-not-so-eli5-introduction-in-2022) first!

## Problem statement üçÄ

GitHub Actions provides the ability to create automated workloads, and CI/CD pipelines. I have 3 different branches: `dev`, `beta`, and `main`. They have the same workflow, which is to build, test, and deploy my application to the GCP App Engine. More details were discussed in my [previous article](brainstorm-a-deployment-process-from-github-to-google-app-engine-and-cloud-sql-part-2).

In my case, only configurations (secrets and environment variables) are different. Maintaining 3 different workflows, one for each, is not recommended due to duplicated code. With that said, how can I create one workflow that uses different secrets based on a triggered branch?

## Key points üçÄ

### Can I make all 3 branches trigger the same workflow? üîë

Yes, there is a key `on` to serve this purpose.

```yaml showLineNumbers
name: My workflow

# Define which action triggers the workflow
on:
  # Name of the action
  push:
    # Filter, define which branch triggers the action
    # I want all branches to trigger this workflow
    branches:
      - dev # Direct push is allowed, this deploys to a staging server
      - beta # Protected branch, no direct push, only accepted merge is allowed
      - main # Protected branch, no direct push, only accepted merge is allowed
```

### How about `if / else if / else` statement to check for branches? üîë

GitHub Actions does support the `if` key, but there is no `else if / else`. Besides, I can use [contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/accessing-contextual-information-about-workflow-runs) to read the current branch name.

The syntax of contexts is `${{ <context> }}`, so I have something as below

```yaml showLineNumbers
steps:
  - name: My step
    # github.ref context is used to determine the branch name
    # It is evaluated against a git's ref name

    # Wrong syntax
    # if: ${{ github.ref }} == 'something'

    # Correct syntax
    # I must use a single quote here
    # It took me a while to determine that a double quote broke the workflow
    if: ${{ github.ref == 'ref/heads/main' }}

    ...
```

### There is no `else if / else` key. üîë

Well, I can use 3 different `if` in 3 different steps. Each one represents a specific branch.

I use [`google-github-actions/auth`](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth) in the first step in my job to authenticate to GCP. At this point, I have 6 different GitHub secrets to test out the concept. Each branch has two secrets with the format `BRANCH_WIP` and `BRANCH_SA`.

```yaml showLineNumbers
# Step for the main branch
- name: MAIN authentication
  if: ${{ github.ref == 'ref/heads/main' }} && ${{ secrets.MAIN_WIP != null }} && ${{ secrets.MAIN_SA != null }}
  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v0
  with:
    workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.MAIN_WIP }}
    service_account: $${{ secrets.MAIN_SA }}

  ...
# Steps for beta and dev branches follow the same structure
# But, the code above will NOT work, I will explain below
```

I use [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test the workflow locally, but it fails with the message `Error: exit with 'FAILURE': 1`. Guess what, `secrets` is not **usable in** `if` **key**, hence the error.

### GitHub Secrets cannot be read in a conditional statement. üîë

GitHub Actions has a key `env` to define environment variables at different scopes in the workflow. I use it at the step level to import the `secrets` because `env` can be read in an `if` key.

```yaml showLineNumbers
- name: MAIN authentication
  env:
    # Define a key pair in using an environment variable.
    WIP: ${{ secrets.MAIN_WIP }}
    SA: ${{ secrets.MAIN_SA }}
  if: ${{ github.ref == 'ref/heads/main' }} && env.WIP != null && env.SA != null
  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v0
  with:
    workload_identity_provider: ${{ env.WIP }}
    service_account: ${{ env.SA }}
    # Note, I need to use '${{ }}' in reusable workflow 'auth@v0' to read 'env'
    # Meanwhile, it is not necessary in the 'if' key.
    # This cost me a fair amount of time to debug
```

### The pre-compiled code base can read environment variables. üîë

However, remember only what is performed inside the GitHub VM can read the variables. The back end, which is uploaded to GAE, is built and tested in a GCP environment. It does not have access to GitHub resources.

```yaml showLineNumbers
- name: Configuration for React environment variables
  if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/dev' }}
  # Build step can read REACT_APP_DEV
  run: |
    echo "REACT_APP_DEV=${{ secrets.DEV }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

### Creating an action 3 times for 3 branches results in duplicated code, should there be a way to refactor? üîë

As of now, the environment variables have their scope limited to a step it stays in. Inside a job, I have `steps` key, which contains multiple steps underneath. Therefore, at the minimum, I need environment variables to have `steps` scope.

Indeed, `steps` scope works. In a job, I can write the variables to `$GITHUB_ENV` at the first step in a `steps` key, so all subsequent steps can access the environment variables. Note, I cannot create a conditional statement at job scope, so maybe only `steps` scope works after all.

I came across an approach using `set-env` command. However, `set-env` [was deprecated due to CVE-2020-15228](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-10-01-github-actions-deprecating-set-env-and-add-path-commands/) and is not usable anymore.

Now, I use `echo "MY_ENV=${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV` instead.

```yaml showLineNumbers
name: CI/CD pipeline

# Define which action triggers the workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev # Direct push is allowed, this deploys to a staging server
      - beta # Protected branch, no direct push, only accepted merge is allowed
      - main # Protected branch, no direct push, only accepted merge is allowed

jobs:
  auth:
    name: Authenticate to GCP
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x]
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write

   steps:
     # I only need to declare environment variables once at the beginning
     # The subsequent steps can access the variables by default
    - name: Configuration for main branch
      if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
      # Side note, I can run any Linux command here, not just 'echo'
      run: |
        echo "GCP_WIP=${{ secrets.MAIN_WIP }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        echo "GCP_SA=${{ secrets.MAIN_SA }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: Configuration for beta branch
      if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/beta' }}
      run: |
        echo "GCP_WIP=${{ secrets.BETA_WIP }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        echo "GCP_SA=${{ secrets.BETA_SA }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: Configuration for beta branch
      if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/dev' }}
      run: |
        echo "GCP_WIP=${{ secrets.DEV_WIP }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        echo "GCP_SA=${{ secrets.DEV_SA }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: Authenticate to GCP
      if:  env.GCP_WIP != null && env.GCP_SA != null
      uses: google-github-actions/auth@v0
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: ${{ env.GCP_WIP }}
        service_account: ${{ env.GCP_SA }}

    ...
```

## Wrap Up üçÄ

Initially, my usage of GitHub Actions only involves simple actions such as `build`, `test`. With conditional workflow, there is a whole new set of possibilities. The article mostly focuses on conditional workflow. However, I should also be aware of some concepts that are occasionally mentioned, either directly or indirectly, throughout the article.

- Contexts
- Scope and hierarchical access
- Reusable workflow
- Custom Linux commands (a workflow is run in a VM)

I will spend some time on the [GitHub Actions documents](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) then.
