## What is GitHub Actions? 🍀

I guess you are familiar with GitHub at this point. Is it more than a version control system to you? As you can see in the image, there is an **Actions** tab which leads to the **GitHub Actions** feature. What is it, you may ask?

GitHub Actions is an automation platform that contains **workflows**, and the workflows can be triggered manually, on schedule, or based on different **events**. It can create a CI/CD pipeline to build, test and deploy your code base. However, as a mature automation platform, it can run arbitrary system commands, so its capability is NOT limited to a CI/CD pipeline.

In my previous article [Advanced GitHub Actions - Conditional Workflow](/advanced-github-actions-conditional-workflow), I dived into the advanced feature. This time, let's start from the ground and discuss the basic concepts of GitHub Actions.

## GitHub Actions anatomy 🍀

GitHub Actions consists of 5 core components:

- Event
- Workflow
- Runner
- Job
- Action

How are they related? An event triggers a workflow, which contains multiple jobs. A runner executes a job, and one job can have multiple actions. By the way, I'm not certain why one component is named action while the platform is already named GitHub Actions, that just sounds confusing. 🤦‍♂️

### What is an event? 🔑

Whenever something happens, it is an event, literally. You may wonder what can be considered events in GitHub Actions, and here, we have 2 types of events.

- Repository eventsThese are the events within the scope of your repository. Some notable examples are creating a pull request and merging code. It can go to the atomic level of how you use GitHub on a daily basis. You can take a look at [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows) to learn more about available events and their usage.
- External eventsThese are what happens outside of your repository. By using a webhook event called [`repository_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch), you can trigger a specific workflow.

### What is a workflow? 🔑

This is something "big" that you want to achieve, a configurable automated process defined by a `yaml` file that resides in the `/.github/workflows` folder. Do you want an end-to-end test process? It can be named _e2e test_. An example of the MUI repository below might give you a better visualization of the GitHub Actions workflow feature.

### What is a runner? 🔑

It is a virtual machine (Linux, Windows, Mac) with an application called [**GitHub Actions Runner**](https://github.com/actions/runner) running. A runner will run a job when a workflow is triggered. The runners can be either self-hosted for customizability or GitHub-hosted.

A job can specify its runner using a `runs-on` property. As each job uses its own runner (fresh virtual machine), its environment data is isolated by default. However, you can share the data by explicitly passing variables or results between them.

> The runner is the application that runs a job from a GitHub Actions workflow. It is used by GitHub Actions in the hosted virtual environments, or you can self-host the runner in your own environment.

### What is a job? 🔑

In GitHub Actions workflow, there are jobs that consist of sequential (and skippable) steps. You can think of the job as a group of tasks to do in order to achieve a goal (workflow). Each step defines a specific operation to be executed, be it a script, a GitHub Actions action, or arbitrary system commands.

Due to its sequential nature, a step is dependent on the previous one. If a previous step modifies an environment, then the later steps are affected by the changes. If one step fails or executes an `exit` command with a failed signal, the workflow will be canceled.

### What is an action? 🔑

If a job is a group of tasks, then an action is a task. An action is repetitive and complex in nature that is created using languages that can be compiled to JavaScript or using bash script in a container. There is a whole [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) that you can a suitable action in there.

## Wrap up 🍀

Hopefully, this helps you learn more about components of the GitHub Actions platform. This article is only a brief introduction to this massive feature. You can learn more about this by using an official GitHub Docs. That said, I think I will write some more articles to have a deeper dive into this feature.

These are just general conventions and are widely acknowledged in the community. They are applicable in a production environment and a great way to start, but certainly, not a one-size-fits-all solution. If your team has already created an internal convention beforehand, then that is what you need to follow.
